<title>Lab 1 - Exercise 6</title>

<body>
<p>Answer:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>The lab was completed</li>
  <li>The cumulative time spent writing the code was <br>
    about 30 minutes with review and corrections</li>
  <li>No major issues but I had to make adjustments to<br> 
    names of files being linked to in order to remove spaces in the names.<br>
    I didnâ€™t know this was an issue until I run the validator</li>
  <li>I was wondering if there was a major difference between putting content<br>
    inside &lt;p&gt; tags compared to &lt;article&gt; or other similar tags save<br>
    for the semantic logic? I mean will there be special uses during google searches<br>
    in identifying important information?</li>
